# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** Agents get curated, high-quality sources instead of SEO-gamed search results — three good sources per topic, human-vetted, cryptographically signed, served via open protocol.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Data Layer

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation & Data Layer)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-02 — Completed 01-03-PLAN.md (Seed registry data)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (3/3 Phase 1 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.15 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 3 | 9 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last plan: 01-03 (2 min)
- Previous: 01-02 (4 min)
- Trend: Accelerating

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Local-first architecture**: Build without Pubky SDK dependency for core phases. PKARR keypair is just crypto — can implement without full SDK. Pubky homeserver/trust graph deferred to v2.
- **Phase structure follows dependency order**: Foundation (data layer) → Business logic (matching) → Protocol (MCP) → Transport (HTTP) → Identity (PKARR) → Infrastructure (Docker/Render) → Documentation/Testing.
- **HashMap for category storage** (01-01): Use HashMap<String, Category> keyed by slug for direct access instead of Vec.
- **Strict serde validation** (01-01): Apply #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)] to ALL registry structs to catch schema violations early.
- **Per-module error enums** (01-01): Each module (registry, mcp, pubky) has its own thiserror-based error enum.
- **Environment config with envy** (01-02): Use envy for type-safe environment variable deserialization with dotenvy for .env support.
- **Structured logging with format switching** (01-02): Support LOG_FORMAT env var to switch between pretty (dev) and json (prod) logging.
- **Fail-fast validation** (01-02): Load registry on startup and crash with descriptive errors if invalid, rather than serving bad data.
- **Source curation standards** (01-03): Prioritize official documentation and primary sources over blog posts, include practical tools, use natural language query patterns.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Architecture decisions validated:**
- Local-first approach confirmed by research — no blocking Pubky SDK dependency
- axum 0.8 + tokio stack is standard Rust pattern
- MCP protocol implementation will be manual (no mature Rust MCP library)

**For future phases:**
- Phase 5 (Identity): PKARR keypair generation — verify ed25519-dalek crate availability during Phase 4 planning
- Phase 6 (Infrastructure): Render free tier 512MB RAM limit — enforce 10MB max registry size in Phase 1
